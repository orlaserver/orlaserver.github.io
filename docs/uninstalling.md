# Uninstalling Orla

Homebrew:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask orla
```

Install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-cns/orla/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh
```

The uninstall script removes only Orla. Ollama and downloaded models are left in place. To remove Ollama:

- Homebrew: `brew uninstall ollama`
- Other: See [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) or your system’s package manager.
